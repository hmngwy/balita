# Why
I just woke up one morning (today, Saturday, February 28) and thought, I want to be able to read news on my terminal, I'm on the terminal all the damned time anyway. So there, a couple of hours was spent writing this.

### Where are the tests?
I uh, well do you want to write it? Fork and send me a PR. I really didn't plan to spend a lot of time on this tiny project, so there's no tests and all that jazz. :)

### What's the news source?
It's just Google News with the "Philippines" filter on.
